# javascript-generator
In this assignment I have put in code that creates a random password once the selected criteria have been inputted. I attached the Js code to the button so that, once clicked the page will show a series of prompts asking what kind of password you would like. When inputted the password generator will then put out a random password meeting your criteria.
